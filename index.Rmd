# Preface {-}

This guide is meant to be a repository of information on both *what* we have decided in terms of various style decisions, as well as *how* to accomplish those decisions. Currently the documentation is limited to books, but it is possible that additional information will be added both for other kinds of works.

Warhorn Classics uses Bookdown to create all its online versions of books. For technical questions about how to accomplish something that is not covered in this guide, [this book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) will likely answer the question or put you on the path to finding out.
