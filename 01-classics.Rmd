# Warhorn Classics Books

Warhorn Classics uses Bookdown to create all its online versions of books. For technical questions about how to accomplish something that is not covered in this guide, [this book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) will likely answer the question or put you on the path to finding out.

## Creating a new book

Once you've followed the instructions and created a new book from the book template, you will need to understand what the files do and how to proceed in customizing the book. The first section below outlines each of the files and what needs to be changed in them when creating a new book. 

### What are all these files?

Below is a list of the files in the book template, along with a description of that file and the contents. If the name of a field inside a file is **bold** below, that means you need to customize that field for a new book.

.gitignore
: Specifies which files are not to be tracked in git. In particular, we only want to track book source, not output files (_book), files related to RStudio, or external files used in the build process (classics-template-files). This file already has the right settings.

.travis.yml
: Imports the actual travis build instructions from the classics-template-files project, and contains the encrypted personal access token that allows TravisCI to push the built books back to GitHub. If you followed the instructions for the template book, you shouldn't need to do anything else to this file.

01-Basic-instructions.Rmd
: Contains the content of the first chapter of the template book. **Should be deleted or renamed** and its content replaced with the first chapter of the new book. See 

_bookdown.yml
: contains some settings for bookdown. 
: 
: Contents:
: 
:  - **book_filename:** Change this to give book downloads, such as PDFs, appropriate filenames. Don't use spaces. Standard: author’s last name followed by short title, like so: \
    `book_filename: "Ryle-Duties_of_Parents"`
:  
: Don’t change anything else in this file, unless you need “chapters” to be called something else. If so, make sure you check all the output formats thoroughly and report back. This is currently untested in our books.

_output.yml
: Contains a number of settings for the various output formats. You shouldn’t need to make changes to this file.

cover.jpg
: **Should be replaced** with an image of the book cover. Alex is working on a simple design that will be able to be used for all of the books. Both JPG and PNG files are supported. 

DESCRIPTION
: A necessary file for bookdown to work properly on Travis CI. Ignore.

index.Rmd
: Contains many settings for the book and the code to automatically include the Classics front matter in each book. Anything not mentioned below should be left unchanged.
: 
: Contents:
: 
:  - **title, author, and date** must all be changed and should be self-explanatory
:  - **description:** Short description of the book. Don't use copyrighted content here. Write your own description. This field is useful for SEO. Also, it is displayed together with the cover image when the book is shared on certain social media.
:  - **params:**
:    - **scans:** Enter a link to scanned images of the original public domain work on Google books, Archive.org, or elsewhere.
:    - build: This can be any number. Change the build number if you ever want to force the book to rebuild but haven’t changed anything else. It’s used for no other purpose.
:  - **cover-image:** the name of the image file being used as the cover for the book. Make sure to include the extension, such as cover.jpg, or cover.png.
:  - **url:** the page where the book is hosted. [Currently](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues/963) must end with a “/“. 
:  - **output:**
      - **bookdown::gitbook:**
        - **config:**
          - **toc:**
            - **before:** This content is shown above the TOC on the web version of the book. Having the book title (and author last name if it will fit), is helpful for people to know what they are looking at. Change this on the second line.
          - **edit:** where the edit link on each page points to. Should be the GitHub project URL, followed by “/edit/master/%s”

README.md
: The description of the repo that will be displayed on the Github project page. **Update this** with some simple info and a link to the readable book. 

book_project.Rproj 
: This file can be ignored. If you use the Rstudio IDE, this is your project file, and you’ll probably want to rename it to the book title just so you don’t get confused which book project you are working on.

images (folder)
: This folder **should be deleted** unless the book you are working on has images. In which case, delete the images that came in the template, and add the new images from the book.


### Adding book content

To add content to the book, simply add Rmd files. 

All the Rmd files will be combined into a book, ordered by filename. So use numbers at the beginning of the files to indicate the order they should go in. Note that index.rmd will always come first, though, and will automatically include the Warhorn Classics front matter. Here is an example list of files in the order they will end up in the book. 

```
index.Rmd
00-preface.Rmd
01-The-Sacraments-In-General.Rmd
02-The-Sacrament-of-Baptism.Rmd
03-The-Sacrament-of-the-Lords-Supper.Rmd
```

Note that the numbers at the beginning of each filename are *only* used to get the files into the proper order in the book. It is handy if they can correspond to the chapter number just to prevent confusion, but it is not necessary.

The online version of the book will be split up into separate pages, not just one long web page. The split will happen at each new .rmd file.[^1] Thus, in most cases a new .rmd file should be created for each chapter. Each .rmd file must begin with the title of the chapter it contains. (The proper syntax is described in the next section.)[^2] 

[^1]: This [can be changed](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/html.html#gitbook-style), if necessary, to split by chapter or section, or even turned off completely.

[^2]: Supposedly the first file must begin with either a chapter ("# Chapter name") *or* a section ("## Section title"). However, it appears that it must be a chapter, as starting with a section causes an error. Latter files may start with a section, instead, if necessary, to split the book into appropriate-length webpages.


### Chapters, sections, and more

The primary structure in Warhorn Classics books is determined by various levels of headers, and it can easily be seen in the automatically generated table of contents.

By default, the top level of structure is called a "chapter." However, this word can be changed in _bookdown.yml if necessary for sermons or other types of works where "chapter" is not appropriate.[^3]

[^3]: The bookdown documentation says it is [also possible](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#special-headers) to split a book into "parts" made up of multiple chapters, as well as add a special "part" called "appendix." However, ebooks and Word documents do not get any "part" information, so we do not support this option in our books. 

The start of a chapter is specified in the text with a # followed by the title of the chapter. Here is an example of the proper syntax:

```markdown
# A Long-expected chapter title
```

Chapters can be broken down further into sections and sub-sections, etc. using additional levels of headers and titles:

```markdown
## This is a section.

### Here is a sub-section.

#### And now a sub-sub-section
```

#### Numbering (or not)

Chapters, sections and subsections will all be automatically numbered, unless you exclude them from numbering by adding "\{-\}" to the end of the line. For example, generally an introduction should not be numbered:

```markdown
# Introduction {-}

Text of the introduction goes here...
```

Or perhaps the subsections in the book are not numbered:

```markdown
# How to write a book

## Getting started

### Arranging your pencils {-}
```

#### Assigning IDs to sections and chapters

Chapters and sections can be assigned custom ids to make it easier to [reference][References] them:

```markdown
# My very long chapter title that I don't want to have to type often {#long-chapter}
```

It is possible to assign an ID *and* specify that a section is not to be numbered like so:

```markdown
## Section forty-five {- #sec-45}
```

## Formatting

### Overview

Formatting should not be used for structural elements such as headers or captions. Our templates will style those elements according to a standard design. Formatting should only be done where the formatting is essential to the text. For example, bold or italics that the author is using for emphasis should be included, whereas if a (sub)section heading is italicized in the source book, that is a question of design.

Formatting is accomplished by using R-markdown. Basically, you can use anything that [Pandoc supports](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown). Where Pandoc supports multiple options, we have generally chosen a specific method. If you need to use something not mentioned below, please suggest it be added here.

### Italics

*Italicized text* is indicated by surrounding it with single asterisks.

```markdown
Here are *a couple* in italics.
```

### Bold

**Bold text** is indicated by surrounding it with double asterisks.

```markdown
Here are **a few words** in bold.
```

### Small caps 

I cannot think of any other circumstance where smallcaps should be used except the word [Lord]{.smallcaps}.

```markdown
[Lord]{.smallcaps}
```

### Centering text

I cannot think of a place where text would need to be centered in the text of a book.

```markdown
::: {.center}
Republished by Warhorn Classics
:::
```

## Special characters

There are a number of special characters that are created using a backslash (\\) before another character. These two-character codes are easily visible in the markdown because of the the backslash, where otherwise they would be difficult to notice.

### Non-breaking spaces

Non-breaking spaces prevent two words from being split onto separate lines. There are a variety of cases in which they are necessary, including Scripture references. They are formed by putting a backslash prior to a regular space.

```markdown
1\ Peter\ 1:3 
```

### Line breaks

Sometimes, you may need to specify that text should start on a new line but remain part of the same paragraph. This can be accomplished by putting a single backslash at the end of a line. 

```markdown
This paragraph will continue \
on the next line.
```

### Backslashes

Because backslashes are are special characters, if one needs to appear for some reason in the actual text of a book, it must be 'escaped' using another backslash. 

```markdown
Two backslashes \\ will appear in the output of the book as a single backslash.
```

## Comments

If you ever need to leave a comment in the source but you don't want it to appear in the built books, you can use the following format. It is the standard HTML comment, but with an extra dash to open it. These comments will not even show up in the HTML source. If you use a regular HTML comment with just two dashes, they will show up in the HTML source.

```markdown
<!---
your comment goes here
and here
-->
```

## Poetry

Poetry should be designated as such so it can be styled differently from the rest of the text

```markdown
::: {.poetry}
Oh when a mother meets on high

The babe she lost in infancy,

Hath she not then for pains and fears,

\ \ \ \ The day of woe, the watchful night,

For all her sorrows, all her tears,

\ \ \ \ An over-payment of delight?
:::
```

Note that each line of poetry should be followed by a double return, as if it were its own paragraph. If a line of poetry should appear indented in its final form, precede the indented line with non-breaking spaces, which are entered as spaces preceded by backslashes.

If reproducing multiple stanzas of poetry, just wrap each stanza in the poetry `div`:

```markdown
::: {.poetry}
This is the first

Stanza of poetry

With three lines.
:::

::: {.poetry}
This is the second

Stanza of poetry

Also with three lines.
:::
```

## Links

Links are easily added using standard markdown like so:

```markdown
This text needs a link [here](http://google.com).
```

## References 

If the author refers to another chapter or section of his book, we can add a link to it without an actual url. All that is necessary is that the we know the chapter or section name. There are two ways to link at that point. If the title of the section or chapter is used verbatim in the text, we can simply surround it in brackets and it will link automatically:

```markdown
Here is how I would add a link to the section titled [Foreign languages].
```

Otherwise, if the exact title isn't used, simply bracket the words you want to link, and then add another set of brackets with the name of the section you want to link to like so:

```markdown
Here is how I would add a link to the section about [non-english content][Foreign languages].
```

If the section is actually we can We can then either simply include the name in brackets and it will automatically link to the section of chapter with that name

## Foreign languages

Any text in a foreign language, regardless of how long or short, should be indicated as such with the appropriate two-letter language code, which can be [found here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp). Here is the what the markup looks like for a couple of the most common languages you might need.

**Latin:**

```markdown
[sacramentum]{lang=la}
```

**Greek:**

```markdown
[μυστηριον]{lang=el}
```


## Typos

Typos can and do appear in the original source documents at times. Our policy is to correct obvious typos, such as spelling errors, making a note of them in the text like so.

```markdown
<!-- Original typo: "profssing" -->
```

Stylistic changes, such as switching from British to American quotes are not considered typos and do not need to be noted. 

However, sometimes a word may be missing, or the wrong word inserted. If you believe you have found a typo, but correcting it changes the meaning of the text, please submit it to the editorial team for evaluation. If a change is made in such a circumstance, it will be noted visibly in the text, either through a footnote or an editorial bracket.


## Images

Images are likely to be rare, but when used, Pandoc's built-in functionality is not enough. Images are to be placed in a sub-folder called "images" and included using knitr commands:

**Centered and 50% width image:**

````markdown
`r ''````{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sepialogo.png")
```
````

Here is what it looks like when used:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sepialogo.png")
```

## Footnotes

Footnotes can added to any content in a book, including section headings or chapter titles (but see warning concerning multi-paragraph footnotes below). 

Please put footnotes in the source directly under the paragraph where the footnote occurs. This will make it much easier to find and edit the footnote in the source document. [Because of (potential) bugs](https://community.rstudio.com/t/how-can-i-enable-the-file-scope-option/83741), every footnote in the book *must* have a unique name.[^fnnaming]

[^fnnaming]: Technically footnotes aren't numbered in our source. They are *named*. They are assigned consecutive numbers per chapter when the book is built. We use numbers for the names in order to simplify the process of editing as well as to guarantee unique names.

The naming should follow this pattern: chapter number, period, footnote number. So the first footnote in the first chapter would be named "01.01". The third footnote in the fifth chapter would be "05.03". A footnote in the intro could be named "intro.01".

**Simple footnote syntax:**

```markdown
Footnotes are often found at the end of a sentence like so.[^01.01]

[^01.01]: Here is the footnote's content, in its own paragraph with a blank line above and below.

Now the main text of the book continues.
```

If the structure of a particular book demands a more detailed naming of footnotes, it may be appropriate to lengthen footnote names for clarity's sake. For example, a book with lengthy sections within chapters might have footnotes named as follows: "01.01.01", "01.01.02", etc., throughout chapter 1, section 1; then "01.02.01", "01.02.02", etc., throughout chapter 1, section 2. The most important thing is that each footnote have a unique name.

**Multi-paragraph footnote:**

Indent latter paragraph(s) in a footnote by four spaces to indicate that the footnote is continuing.[^4]


[^4]: Here is my multiparagraph footnote, just to prove that it works.

    See? Second paragraph works just fine. :)

```markdown
Longer footnotes can also appear in books.[^01.02]

[^01.02]: Another (longer) footnote. It is possible to have multiple paragraphs in a footnote.

    Simply put four spaces before the next paragraph(s) to indicate that the footnote is continuing.
  
Here is the next paragraph of the book. It is no longer part of the footnote.
```

**Warning**: Multi-paragraph footnotes *cannot* occur inside bold or italic text or chapter or section headers, because of [a bug](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/6733) in Pandoc. However, they do work within blockquotes. There may be other similar places yet to be found. Check for footnotes inside formatted text if rendering the PDF fails with an error something like this: `! Paragraph ended before \text@command was complete.` If you find another place where multi-paragraph footnotes don't work, please update this documentation.
