# Warhorn Classics Books

Warhorn Classics uses Bookdown to create all its online versions of books. For technical questions about how to accomplish something that is not covered in this guide, [this book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) will likely answer the question or put you on the path to finding out.

## Book structure

### Parts, chapters, sections, and more

The primary structure in Warhorn Classics books is determined by various levels of headers, and it can easily be seen in the automatically generated table of contents.

By default, the top level of structure is called a "chapter." However, this word can be changed in _bookdown.yml if necessary for sermons or other types of works where "chapter" is not appropriate. Each chapter is specified with a # followed by the title of the chapter:

```markdown
# A Long-expected chapter title
```

Chapters can be broken down further into sections and sub-sections, etc. using additional levels of headers:

```markdown
## This is a section.

### Here is a sub-section.

#### Here is a sub-sub-section
```

Chapters, sections and subsection will all be automatically numbered, unless you exclude them from numbering by adding "\{-\}" to the end of the chapter name.

A new .rmd (or .md) file should be created for each chapter, and the file must begin with the title of the chapter as outlined above. The various files will all be combined into a book

each markdown file is treated as its own 


## Formatting

### Overview

Formatting should not be used for structural elements such as headers or captions. Our templates will style those elements according to a standard design. Formatting should only be done where the formatting is essential to the text. For example, bold or italics that the author is using for emphasis should be included, whereas if a (sub)section heading is italicized in the source book, that is a question of design.

Formatting is accomplished by using R-markdown. Basically, you can use anything that [Pandoc supports](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown). Where Pandoc supports multiple options, we have generally chosen a specific method. If you want to 
### Italics

*Italicized text* is indicated by surrounding it with single asterisks.

```markdown
Here are *a couple* in italics.
```

### Bold

**Bold text** is indicated by surrounding it with double asterisks.

```markdown
Here are **a few words** in bold.
```

### Small caps 

I cannot think of any other circumstance where smallcaps should be used except the word [Lord]{.smallcaps}.

```markdown
[Lord]{.smallcaps}
```

### Centering text

I cannot think of a place where text would need to be centered in the text of a book.

```markdown
::: {.center}
Republished by Warhorn Classics
:::
```

## Special characters

There are a number of special characters that are created using a backslash (\\) before another character. These two-character codes are easily visible in the markdown because of the the backslash, where otherwise they would be difficult to notice.

### Non-breaking spaces

Non-breaking spaces prevent two words from being split onto separate lines. There are a variety of cases in which they are necessary, including Scripture references. They are formed by putting a backslash prior to a regular space.

```markdown
1\ Peter\ 1:3 
```

### Line breaks

Sometimes (for example in poetry), you need to specify that text should start on a new line but remain part of the same paragraph. This can be accomplished by putting a single backslash at the end of a line. 

```markdown
This paragraph will continue \
on the next line.
```

### Backslashes

Because backslashes are are special characters, if one needs to appear for some reason in the actual text of a book, it must be 'escaped' using another backslash. 

```markdown
Two backslashes \\ will appear in the output of the book as a single backslash.
```


## Poetry

Poetry should be designated as such so it can be styled differently from the rest of the text

```markdown
::: {.poetry}
"Oh when a mother meets on high \
The babe she lost in infancy,

Hath she not then for pains and fears, \
The day of woe, the watchful night,

For all her sorrows, all her tears, \
An over-payment of delight?"
:::
```


## Foreign languages

Any text in a foreign language, regardless of how long or short, should be indicated as such with the appropriate two-letter language code, which can be [found here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp). Here is the what the markup looks like for a couple of the most common languages you might need.

**Latin:**

```markdown
[sacramentum]{lang=la}
```

**Greek:**

```markdown
[μυστηριον]{lang=el}
```

## Images

Images are likely to be rare, but when used, Pandoc's built-in functionality is not enough. Images are to be placed in a sub-folder called "images" and included using knitr commands:

**Centered and 50% width image:**

````markdown
`r ''````{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sepialogo.png")
```
````

Here is what it looks like when used:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sepialogo.png")
```

## Footnotes

Insert the text of footnotes directly under the paragraph where the footnote occurs. This will make it much easier to find and edit the footnote in the source document.

**Simple footnote:**

```markdown
Footnotes are often found at the end of a sentence like so.[^1]

[^1]: Here is the footnote's content, in its own paragraph with a blank line above and below.

Now the main text of the book continues.
```

**Multi-paragraph footnote:**

```markdown
Longer footnotes can also appear in books.[^2]

[^2]: Another footnote. It is possible to have multiple paragraphs in a footnote.

  Simply put two spaces before the next paragraph(s) to indicate that the footnote is continuing.
  
Here is the next paragraph of the book. It is no longer part of the footnote.
```
