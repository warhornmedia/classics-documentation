Warhorn Classics uses Bookdown to create all its online versions of books. For technical questions about how to accomplish something that is not covered in this guide, [this book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) will likely answer the question or put you on the path to finding out.

### Book structure

#### Parts, chapters, sections, and more

The primary structure in Warhorn Classics books is determined by various levels of headers, and it can easily be seen in the automatically generated table of contents.

By default, the top level of structure is called a "chapter." However, this word can be changed in _bookdown.yml if necessary for sermons or other types of works where "chapter" is not appropriate. Each chapter is specified with a # followed by the title of the chapter:

```markdown
# A Long-expected Party
```

Chapters can be broken down further into sections and sub-sections, etc. using additional levels of headers:

```markdown
## This is a section.

### Here is a sub-section.

#### Here is a sub-sub-section
```

Chapters, sections and subsection will all be automatically numbered, unless you exclude them from numbering using "\{-\}."

A new .rmd (or .md) file should be created for each chapter, and the file must begin with the title of the chapter as outlined above. The various files will all be combined into a book

each markdown file is treated as its own 



### Formatting

Formatting should never be used for structural elements such as headers or captions. Our templates will style those elements properly. 

Formatting is accomplished by using R-markdown. Basically, you can use anything that [Pandoc supports](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown). Where Pandoc supports multiple options, we have generally chosen a specific method. If you want to 

#### Small caps 

```markdown
[Lord]{.smallcaps}
```

#### Centering text

Centering text should almost 

```markdown
::: {.center}
Republished by Warhorn Classics
:::
```

#### Non-breaking space

Non-breaking spaces prevent the text from being split onto separate lines. There are a variety of cases in which they are necessary, including Scripture references. They are formed by putting a backslash prior to a regular space.

```markdown
1\ Peter\ 1:3 
```


### Foreign languages

Any text in a foreign language, regardless of how long or short, should be indicated as such with the appropriate two-letter language code, which can be [found here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp). Here is the what the markup looks like for a couple of the most common languages you might need.

**Latin:**

```markdown
[sacramentum]{lang=la}
```

**Greek:**

```markdown
[μυστηριον]{lang=el}
```

### Images

Images are likely to be rare, but when used, Pandoc's built-in functionality is often not enough to give us good PDF output. As such we use knitr like so:

**Centered and 50% width image:**
````markdown
`r ''````{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/whitelogo.png")
```
````

### Footnotes

Insert the text of footnotes directly under the paragraph where the footnote occurs. This will make it much easier to find and edit the footnote in the source document.

**Footnote marker:**

```markdown
Typically found at the end of a sentence like so.[^1]
```
**Footnote content:**

```markdown
[^1]: Here is the content. It must be a separate paragraph with a blank line above and below.
```

**Multi-paragraph footnote:**

```markdown
[^2]: It is possible to append another paragraph to a footnote.

  Simply put two spaces before the next paragraph to indicate that the footnote is continuing.
```
